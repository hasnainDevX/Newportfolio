  {
    question: "How much does a website cost?",
    answer: "Packages start from £200 and go up depending on the scope — number of pages, features, animations, and so on. The packages page has a full breakdown, but if you're still unsure, just fill out the enquiry form and I'll give you a straight answer based on what you actually need.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why custom code instead of Wix, WordPress, or Squarespace?",
    answer: "Builders are convenient, but they come with a cost — bloated code, slow load times, generic layouts, and monthly fees that add up. A custom-coded site is leaner, faster, and built exactly around your business. No unused plugins, No monthly Fee ever, no one-size-fits-all templates. You own it completely.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I update the website myself after it's built?",
    answer: "Yes — on the Signature and Complete Vision packages, your site comes with a custom content management system. You can update text, swap images, add blog posts, and manage pages without touching a single line of code. It's built to be genuinely easy to use, not just technically possible.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the process take?",
    answer: "The Foundation Site typically wraps up in 1–2 weeks. Larger projects run 3–8 weeks depending on scope. The biggest factor is usually how quickly content and feedback come through on your end — I'll always give you a clear timeline upfront so nothing drags.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer payment plans?",
    answer: "Yes. A deposit is required to lock in your start date, with the remainder due before launch. The Signature and Complete Vision packages also have 2 and 3-month split payment options respectively — details are on the packages page.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will my website work on mobile?",
    answer: "Every site is fully responsive and tested across phones, tablets, and desktops before it goes live. Mobile isn't an add-on — it's built in from the start, since that's where most of your visitors will land anyway.",
  },
  {
    question: "I'm not sure which package is right for me.",
    answer: "That's completely fine — most people aren't sure before we talk. Fill out the enquiry form with a rough idea of what you're after and I'll come back to you with a recommendation. No pressure, no sales pitch.",
